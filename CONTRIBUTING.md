# Contributing to HeroTerminal Docs

Thanks for wanting to improve the HeroTerminal documentation.

This repo is focused on the written docs only. The simulator, web app and Case File content all live in separate repositories.

## What you can help with

Good documentation contributions include:

- Fixing typos and grammar.
- Improving explanations that are unclear or confusing.
- Adding short examples that make a concept easier to understand.
- Updating references when behaviour or naming has changed.

Please keep contributions focused and practical. Large rewrites or structural changes should be discussed in an issue first.
