# Bootcamp Design Overview

HeroTerminal bootcamps are structured story arcs. Each bootcamp bundles a set of missions, optional custom commands, and the HeroCert that players earn upon completion.

A healthy bootcamp includes:
- A clear theme or incident narrative.
- 3–6 missions that escalate in difficulty.
- Consistent scoring aligned with the global rules.
- Optional supporting assets such as custom commands, inbox messages, or overlays.

Use this section together with the `bootcamp.yaml` and mission references to plan your story before touching YAML. Sketch the incident, define the investigation beats, then translate them into missions with concrete win conditions.
