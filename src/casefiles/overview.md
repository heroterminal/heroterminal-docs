# Case File Design Overview

HeroTerminal Case Files are structured noir investigations. Each Case File bundles a set of Leads, and the HeroCert that investigators earn upon completion.

A healthy Case File includes:
- A clear theme or incident narrative.
- 3–6 Leads that escalate in difficulty.
- Consistent Reputation awards aligned with the global rules.
- Optional supporting assets such as inbox messages, or overlays.

Use this section together with the Case File manifest (`case.yaml`) and Lead references to plan your story before touching YAML. Sketch the incident, define the investigation beats, then translate them into Leads with concrete Findings.
