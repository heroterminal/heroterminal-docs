# Hero Terminal – Reputation Guidelines (v2)

### 📊 Lead Valuation Standard

Reputation should reflect the complexity of the investigative step and the technical knowledge required to solve it.

* **Beginner Lead:** 25–75 Rep
* **Intermediate Lead:** 75–150 Rep
* **Advanced Lead:** 150–250 Rep

### 📏 The Rules of Engagement

1.  **The Ceiling:** Never assign more than **250 Rep** to a single Lead.
2.  **The Floor:** Never go below **10 Rep** (unless it's a pure tutorial step).
3.  **Case Totals:** For a standard Case File (3–5 Leads), the total payout should generally land between **~200 and 600 Rep**.
4.  **The Splitting Rule (Crucial):** If you think a single Lead deserves *more* than 250 Rep, it is too complex. **Split it into multiple, smaller Leads.**
