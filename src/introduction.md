# Introduction

Welcome to the HeroTerminal developer docs. HeroTerminal is now **Mystery-as-Code**: every investigation is defined as text + assets in git, layered into the Lens filesystem at runtime.

Terminology (legacy → current):
- **Bootcamp** → **Case File**
- **Mission** → **Lead**
- **Answer/Submit** → **Finding / File Report**

What you’ll find here:
- How to author case/lead YAML (legacy filenames remain for now).
- How the layered filesystem works (Investigator Home → Lead overlay on `~/desk` with drawer rollover).
- How validation and the APIs behave.
