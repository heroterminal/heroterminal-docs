# Introduction

Welcome to the HeroTerminal Developer Docs.

Use this reference when you plan, validate, and submit new bootcamps. Every scenario that lands in production follows the same structure, scoring rules, and API contracts described here.

These docs cover:
- The YAML specification for bootcamps and missions.
- How validation works (API and helper script).
- The scoring guidelines and submission process.
