# New Investigator Dossier: Submission Template
Instructions: Define your investigator before you write their first case. This establishes their "rules."

### 🔢 1. The Basics
*   **Full Name:**
*   **Age:**
*   **Base Location:** (e.g., Berlin, London, Tokyo, rural Texas. Must be a real place.)
*   **Their "Peugeot":** (How do they travel? Luc has his old car. Does yours take the U-Bahn? Ride a bicycle? Walk everywhere? This defines their relationship with the city.)

### 🧠 2. The Psychology & Tone
*   **The Vibe in 3 Words:** (e.g., "Cold, Analytical, Efficient" OR "Chaotic, Charming, Lucky")
*   **The Major Flaw:** (What holds them back? Be specific.)
*   **Their "Voice":** (How do they speak in their notes? Are they poetic? Bullet-pointed? Angry? Funny?)
*   **Relationship with Tech:** (Do they love it? Hate it? Tolerate it?)

### 🤝 3. The Handler (The "Claire" Equivalent)
*   **Who gives them assignments?**
*   **What is the dynamic?** (Are they enemies? Lovers? A faceless algorithm? An old mentor?)

### 🗺️ 4. The Territory & Edutainment Focus
*   **What kind of locations will they explore?**
*   **What kind of "secrets" will players learn from them?** (e.g., A Berlin investigator might teach about Cold War infrastructure. A Tokyo investigator might teach about urban density zoning.)

### Example Investigator: Klara "Glitch" Weber
*   **Location:** Berlin.
*   **Vibe:** Cold, hyper-technical, socially awkward.
*   **The Flaw:** She can't talk to people (unlike Luc). She only trusts data. If a witness says one thing and the data says another, she believes the data 100% (which is sometimes wrong).
*   **Their "Peugeot":** U-Bahn (subway). She hates going above ground. She describes the world from U-Bahn stations and technical infrastructure.
*   **Handler:** "The Collective" – an anonymous group of hackers in an encrypted chat. No personal connection.
