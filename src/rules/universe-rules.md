# HeroTerminal Universal Protocols: The Core Pillars

**Welcome to the Collective.**

HeroTerminal is not just a puzzle platform. It is an interactive narrative engine designed to immerse players in grounded, noir-style investigations.

Whether your investigator is a technophobe in Lyon, a hacker in Berlin, or a journalist in Tokyo, **every single Case File across the entire platform must adhere to these three core pillars.**

If your idea doesn't fit these pillars, it doesn't fit HeroTerminal.

## Pillar 1: The Knowledge Mandate (Fróðleikurinn)

**The primary goal of HeroTerminal is edutainment.** The player must walk away from every investigation knowing something real about the world that they didn't know before.

### 1.1. The World is Real (Staðarhættir)
Every case must be grounded in real-world geography.
* **Rule:** You cannot invent cities. You must use real locations, streets, buildings, and historical contexts.
* **Goal:** The player should feel like they have virtually visited a place. If a case is set in Hamburg, they should learn about the Speicherstadt district or the history of the port. If it's in Lyon, they learn about the traboules.

### 1.2. The "Hidden Fact" Requirement
Every Lead (folder) within a case should contain at least one "nugget" of real-world information woven into the narrative or flavor text.
* *Good:* Solving a puzzle reveals a password.
* *Better (HeroTerminal Standard):* Solving a puzzle reveals a password *which is derived from an obscure historical fact about the building the suspect is hiding in.*

## Pillar 2: Narrative Immersion (Upplifunin)

**We are creating interactive cinema/literature.** The experience should feel like binging a high-quality crime show or reading a gripping noir novel, but the player is in the driver's seat.

### 2.1. Story Over Puzzles
The technical puzzles (the logs, ciphers, data crunching) exist to serve the story, not the other way around.
* **Rule:** Never break narrative immersion for the sake of a difficult puzzle. The puzzle must make sense within the context of the scene.
* **Goal:** The player should feel the tension of the investigation, not the frustration of a math test.

### 2.2. Atmosphere is Key
The "Flavor" files (descriptions, emails, notes) are just as important as the "Evidence" files. They set the mood, tone, and emotional stakes of the case.

## Pillar 3: Grounded Investigation (Rannsóknin)

HeroTerminal is about the *process* of investigation, respecting human limitations and reality.

### 3.1. No Superpowers (Raunsæi)
* **Physics applies:** No magic, no psychic abilities, no sci-fi tech that doesn't exist today.
* **Human Limits:** Investigators get tired, they make mistakes, they have biases. The player must navigate these flaws.

### 3.2. Learning the Process
The player is stepping into the shoes of a professional. They should learn *how* to think like an investigator:
* Cross-referencing conflicting data sources.
* Following a paper trail across different locations.
* Understanding that human witnesses are unreliable, but logs usually tell the truth (if you know how to read them).

**Summary for New Authors:**
If you can create a compelling mystery that teaches the player a real fact about a real place, while making them feel like the star of a noir thriller, you belong here.
